{"name":"IncludeOS","tagline":"A minimal, service oriented, includeable operating system for cloud","body":"### Run your C++ code directly on virtual hardware\r\nIncludeOS aims to be the thinnest, lightest possible layer, between your C++ code and virtual hardware. We provde a bootloader, standard libraries, lots (we hope) of modules, and the build- and deployment system. You provide the service.\r\n\r\n### It's a prototype - be patient!\r\nIncludeOS is not production ready - but we're working hard to become so.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nIncludeOS was created by @alfred-bratterud, with lots of contributions from @fwsgonzo and others at HiOA (Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences) \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble? Please not that this is a prototype! Feel free to post issues in the issue tracker, or contact us via mail, for general questions.\r\n","google":"UA-19624400-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
